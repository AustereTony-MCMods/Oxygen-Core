0.10.3b [2020-02-21]
+ Added basic API for using scripts. Using scripts will be optional, they will be supported by some modules. 
Script support will be provided through adapters, which will allow using different scripting languages.
+ Updated API for working with player’s inventory. Support for custom providers for inventory is available, 
which will ensure the compatibility of Oxygen services with custom inventory.
+ Minor fixes for netweork system and Oxygen synchronization system.

0.10.2b [2020-02-02]
+ Fixed synchronization failure of privilege system data in the privileges menu (for operators) after creating a new world.
+ The option to turn off sound effects now affects only additional menu effects - notification, purchase, etc.

0.10.1b [2020-01-30]
+ Fixed data synchronization.
+ The outdated java time API has been replaced with the new java 1.8 time API.
+ Added a system for checking PVP mode based on Forge events.

0.10.0b [2020-01-17]
+ The privilege system has been improved. The system of groups is replaced by roles, a player can have up to five roles.
The role defines privileges (permissions) available to the player and chat formatting (if active) - prefix and colors.
By default, players do not have roles, their permissions are determined by configuration. To view player roles and manage privileges
(for operators) a special menu has been added. The menu can be invoked with the command / oxygenc core -privileges. You can also open it through
general menu (Oxygen Menu).
+Privileges added:
  - "core:exposeOfflinePlayers" [id - 10, type - BOOLEAN] - the ability to see players online with "offline" activity status and interact with them (in the menu).
  
+ The virtual currency system has been improved, oxygen now supports several virtual currencies at a time. Main currency
is oxygen coins [index 0], additional currencies can be used only in some modules (eg Merchants).
Two new currencies have been added: shards [index 1] and vauchers [index 2]. It is possible to customize currency widgets (icons and names).
+ Changed the principle of currency providers. The provider can now be used to replace existing currencies or
adding a new one (the currency depends on the particular mode for which the provider is used). Several providers can be used.
at a time. The provider currency index is configured through the provider config, by default, any provider replaces the main currency - oxygen
coins [index 0]. For providers, the option of forced balance synchronization is available, which should be used if the mod adding currency
acts as an API for other modifications (example: using the Grand Economy to interact with the Sponge economy).
+ Chat commands has been improved. Oxygen adds three commands for which other modules register their arguments: /oxygenc (available only to the client),
/oxygens (available for any player, used for server operations), /oxygenop (available for operators (permission level 2) and console). 
Commands that take a player’s nickname as an argument support target selectors.

activity is possible no more than 1 time per second). Cooldown is set for all requests sent, for most operations it is 1 second.
+ Added timeout system. Timeouts are used to filter the operations of players who should not be executed without a specific condition (eg sending requests 
for the purchase of goods from merchants (Merchants) will be possible only for a certain time after the authorized menu opening).

tabs of creative inventory of the vanilla game and do not change dynamically. Categories can be customized.
